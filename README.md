# hack-a-thing-1-rhl-unity

For this assignment, I followed a Unity3D [Tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/space-shooter-tutorial)
that stepped me through the process of creating a Space Shooter game. The finished game is
deployed [here](http://rampant-hill.surge.sh).

What I learned:
- how Unity3D works
- C# scripting
- that it's fun to make interactive games

What didn't work:
- the tutorial is based on a previous version of Unity, so lots of the instructions were outdated and
  required some fiddling around.
